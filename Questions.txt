Questions for Prof. André:

- Kölbl et al. used symbolic runs since the symbolic state space is guaranteed to be finite for TAs
-> neither symbolic nor concrete state space is guaranteed to be finite for PTAs, so it should not make a difference, which one I use right?
- Admissibility for PTAs: Constraining parameters always leads to different untimed traces right?
- Otherwise take a concrete example from set of parameters, use inverse method?
